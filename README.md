React Native Project — Udacity React Developer Nanodegree

This is the third project of the [React Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019).

* [MyReads](https://github.com/mmlak-0109/reactnd-project-myreads) — React Fundamentals Project
* [Would You Rather](https://github.com/mmlak-0109/reactnd-project-would-you-rather) — React & Redux Project
* [UdaciCards](https://github.com/mmlak-0109/UdaciCards) — React Native Project

## Project Overview:

'UdaciCards' is a React Native mobile application that allows users to study collections of flashcards. The app will allow users to create different categories of flashcards called "decks", add flashcards to those decks, and take quizzes on those decks.

## How to Load the App

First, navigate to the directory where you want to save the app and run this code:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/mmlak-0109/UdaciCards.git
```
Then ```cd``` into the apps main directory.

Run ```yarn install``` to install all dependencies.
(While ```npm``` should work, I used ```yarn``` as my package manager, so please do the same.)

Once all of the dependencies have been installed you can launch the development server with ```yarn web```.

A new browser window should automatically open displaying Expo DevTools running at ```http://localhost:19002```.

Scan the QR Code with the Android or iOS Expo App to run the application.

## Testing
I tested the app by hand on both iOS and Android.
- iOS
    - Tested on an iPhone 8, 10, 11, and 12 (iOS 14.5) using the XCode emulator.
- Android
    - Tested on a physical LG V20 Pro (Android 8.0.0) using the Android Expo App.
